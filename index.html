      </div>
      <p>I first came across the idea of becoming a web developer after researching careers that don't require a university degree. But it wasn't the salary or the current demand that kept me learning, for when I started learning, I was hooked! I now have a passion for coding and web development and hope to be starting a career as a Junior Web Developer very soon. From what I lack in formal education, I make up for in my self-taught knowledge, logical thinking, my work ethic, and my enthusiasm for learning the newest languages and frameworks. In my spare time, I love to play the guitar, play card games such as Hearthstone, or simply spend time with my fiancee and 2 kids :). If you or your company have an available position, or  simply like to talk to me about this website or any of my projects (coming soon), let me know via my contact information, I would love to hear from you.</p>
