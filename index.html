      <h1>About</h1>
    </div>
    <p>I first came across the idea of becoming a web developer after researching careers that don't require a university degree. After starting my journey, I now have a passion for coding and web development and hope to be starting a career as a Junior
      Web Developer very soon. From what I lack in formal education, I make up for in my self-taught knowledge, logical thinking, my work ethic, and my enthusiasm for learning the newest languages and frameworks. In my spare time, I love to play the guitar,
      play card games such as Hearthstone, or simply spend time with my fiancee and 2 kids :).</p>
