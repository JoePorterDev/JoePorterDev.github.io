      <p>My name is Joe Porter and I am a Web Developer in training. I have a passion for coding and web development and hope to be starting a career as Junior Web Developer very soon. From what I lack in formal education, I make up for in my self-taught knowledge, my work ethic, and my enthusiasm for learning new things. If you or your company have an available position, let me know via my contact information.</p>
